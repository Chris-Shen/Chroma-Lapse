Chroma-Lapse
============
Chroma-Lapse is an interactive video installation that demonstrates the techniques used to display images on screens. By separating live video into red, green and blue, with a delay on the green and blue components, with movement this shows the layers of the RGB colour model separating the image in real time. â€“ Chris Shen
